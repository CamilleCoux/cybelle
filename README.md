### Occupancy analysis with citizen science data from Cybelle Planete / ObsEnMEr

This repository contains code and a .Rmd/.pdf demo to run an occupancy analysis in R using the "unmarked" package.

The purpose is to provide a fun example of how to produce a series of predictive maps based on observations of striped dolphins _Stenella coeruleoalba_ in the Mediterranean Sea over 5 years. As such, the focus here is on the method, rather than on the fine tweaking of the model fit itself or the results, which have not been Ãªer reviewed.

The raw sampling data can be dowloaded from the [ObsEnMer website](https://www.obsenmer.org/), but for simplicity I use a processed version of these data, which I can send on request.
